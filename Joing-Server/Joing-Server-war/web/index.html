  Join'g is about ubiquity, it takes full advantage of the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="java">java technology</a>
    multi platform features, making it possible to access Join'g client
    from most computer operating systems and many other devices such as
    palm PCs and even cell phones. Your data and applications will live
    inside a remote server, they will be available from any device or
    any place you connect from. You will no longer need to carry your
    files and applications in a data storage device.
</p>

<p>
    Join'g needs no client set up. It's client is accessible through
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/" target="java">Java Web Start</a>,
    no client software install nor update is needed. Client-server
    communication is performed through the HTTP and the secure HTTP
    protocols, you can use Join'g from behind a firewall without any
    special configuration.
</p>

<p>All you need to run a Join'g client is a
    <a href="http://www.java.com/" target="java">Java Virtual Machine</a>
and an internet connection.</p>

<p>

    need the server software available at
